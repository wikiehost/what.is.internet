Internet is an architecture designed to interconnect computers from all around the world. It is also sometimes referred to as the network of networks. This is because the internet is made up of several smaller networks.

Domestic networks, government networks, military networks, etc. are some of the small networks that make the internet as a whole. It is the work of several repeaters, cables, data centers, network towers, etc. to let the information travel through the connected computers.

In this article, we will study the history of the internet and how has it affected the lives of people.



## How does the Internet work?

Now you must be thinking, how can we connect millions of devices from all around the world. How can information be reached to several people at the same time? We will clear all your doubts one by one.

Although the complete working of the internet is a bit complicated still we will understand it through simple steps and examples.

Think of the internet as communication between computers, and there are a set of rules that they have to abide by to speak and listen. It is the work of Internet Protocol that lets us communicate with other computers.

The internet protocol sets addresses for each connected computer. These are called IP addresses and used to find each other on the network just like our house addresses.

Now the messages/ information is broken down and sent in the form of small packets that get reassembled again at the receiving point. These messages cannot get lost as each computer has a unique IP address that is a series of numbers.

Now there are several computers on a network, and this might create confusion despite unique addresses. These message transfers are handled by the Packet Routing Network, and this is why a router is required to set up.

The Transfer Control Protocol is another system that makes sure no packet is lost or left behind. As It might create a disrupted message at the receiving end.

Let us review how the message is transferred.

1. Computer1 sends a message to Computer2 by its IP address.

2. The message is broken into small pieces- packets.

3. The packets are transferred concerning Transfer Protocol so that the quality is maintained.

4. The packets reach Computer2 and are reassembled at their IP address.

The Internet works in a way more complicated manner than these few steps, but this might explain its basic working.
